# Libft
42Cursus Project - Libft

Project file:  [en.subject.pdf](https://github.com/CarinaChen423/Libft/files/14897988/en.subject.pdf)
I only did the Mandatory part for this project since I did't have enough time to finish it, and if you use tester to check these functions, there is one mistake in ft_calloc but I passed Moulinette.

Tester for this project I highly recommend:
